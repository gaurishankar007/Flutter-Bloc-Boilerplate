# Git Commands Cheat Sheet ðŸ“‹

A collection of essential and frequently used git commands to boost your productivity.

## 1. General
- âœ… `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
- âœ… `git clone <url>`: Clones an existing Git repository.
- âœ… `git status`: Shows the current state of the working directory.
- âœ… `git add <file>`: Stages changes in a file.
- âœ… `git add ."`: Stage all your changes.
- âœ… `git commit -m "<message>"`: Commits staged changes with a message.
- âœ… `git remote add <remote_name> <url>`: Adds a new remote repository with a given name and URL.
- âœ… `git push -u <remote_name> <branch_name>"`:  Push your local branch to a remote repository and `-u` flag sets the upstream branch for your local branch. This means that subsequent git push commands to the same remote and branch will push your commits directly without specifying the remote and branch names again.

- âœ… `git checkout -b <branch_name> <base_branch_name>`: Creates a new branch based on the specified branch and switches to it. This means that the new branch will start at the same commit as the specified branch.

- âœ… `git merge --no-commit <branch_name>`: Merges the specified branch but doesn't create a merge commit immediately. This allows you to review the changes before committing.
- âœ… `git merge --abort`: Aborts an ongoing merge process.
- âœ… `git merge --continue`: Continues a merge process after resolving conflicts.
- âœ… `git mergetool`: Opens a visual merge tool to help resolve conflicts.
- âœ… `git merge --squash <branch_name>`: Merges the specified branch into the current branch, combining all commits into a single commit.
